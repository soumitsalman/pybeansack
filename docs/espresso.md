# Espresso: Your Daily Shot of Curated Insights

_"How do I find stuff that is interesting?"_ That was the question that sparked the creation of **Espresso**. It all began one breezy October evening, over cigars and some dubious moonshine shared with my long-time partner in questionable decisions, Danny. Among all the topics that came up, this one stuck: _How do we help people discover content that truly matters to them?_

Espresso, a product of **Project Cafecito**, is our attempt to answer that question. It’s a news and social media aggregator designed to deliver only the content that you care about.

**How It Works:**

At its core, Espresso employs a background worker we affectionately call the **Barista**. Every day, Barista tirelessly combs through countless news sites, blogs, and social media posts, curating and processing content for you. It generates summaries, TL;DRs, categories, tags, and trend rankings to help you quickly grasp what's happening in the world. All this data is stored in **Beansack**, our production database, where it is kept fresh for 30 days.

Espresso currently comes in a mobile-friendly web interface and as a Slack bot, designed to fit seamlessly into your daily workflow. While it’s still in the alpha phase, and yes, you might occasionally come across random texts like "baa-baa-baananaaaa" or bizarre categorizations that defy reason, we’re continuously refining our AI models to make it better.

**What Espresso Is — And Isn't:**

We are **not** a new social media platform, nor do we have any intention of becoming one. The original content is hosted on various external sources (that are **not** us!). What we offer are AI-generated digests of this content, giving you a quick snapshot so you can decide whether the original is worth diving into. Our goal is to save you from wasting time on clickbait and shallow content.

So, clickbait creators — go eat a… well, not an Espresso.

**Where We’re Headed:**

Today, Espresso ~~doesn’t track per-user engagement~~ (yes, it doooooees!) and doesn't fine-tune itself based on your personal preferences — but that’s coming soon. We’re hard at work to make Espresso a smarter, more personalized tool so that every session feels like a quick, invigorating shot of espresso tailored to your tastes.

Join us on this journey as we brew the perfect cup of content just for you.

**Espresso** — Stay ahead, effortlessly.
